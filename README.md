Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler

Here's the accpetance criteria:

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
The starter code uses the Moment.js (Links to an external site.) library to work with date and time, 
but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project. 

The theme, colors and layout are all bootstrap. The font is from google fonts. Moment.js provided the time functionality. It was my first time using third-party APIs. Fun!
I can improve on the functionality of this prject if looking for a more expansive use of the calendar. 

Shout out to Sean C and Bryan H for your insights on this one.
